tinythemer is a C port of BasicThemer5, which was written in Golang.
Most of the code is based off of it. Also includes a -reverse (case sensitive!)
command-line argument to revert basic theme changes. As lightweight as
the original version (125kb, no CPU usage, only ~2MB memory consumption.)

To build, run build.sh under MSYS2/MINGW64.
